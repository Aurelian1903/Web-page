					<p>Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the case, central processing unit (CPU), monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, graphics card, sound card, speakers and motherboard.

					By contrast, software is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Hardware is so-termed because it is "hard" or rigid with respect to changes, whereas software is "soft" because it is easy to change.

					Hardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or instruction. A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system, although other systems exist with only hardware.
					</p>
					<p>The personal computer is one of the most common types of computer due to its versatility and relatively low price. Desktop personal computers have a monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, and a computer case. The computer case holds the motherboard, fixed or removable disk drives for data storage, the power supply, and may contain other peripheral devices such as modems or network interfaces. Some models of desktop computers integrated the monitor and keyboard into the same case as the processor and power supply. Separating the elements allows the user to arrange the components in a pleasing, comfortable array, at the cost of managing power and data cables between them.

					<p>When using computer hardware, an upgrade means adding new or additional hardware to a computer that improves its performance, increases its capacity, or adds new features. For example, a user could perform a hardware upgrade to replace the hard drive with a faster one or a Solid State Drive (SSD) to get a boost in performance. The user may also install more Random Access Memory (RAM) so the computer can store additional temporary data, or retrieve such data at a faster rate. The user may add a USB 3.0 expansion card to fully use USB 3.0 devices, or could upgrade the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) for cleaner, more advanced graphics, or more monitors. Performing such hardware upgrades may be necessary for aged computers to meet a new, or updated program's system requirements.</p>
					<p>Most hardware upgrades aren't hugely difficult, but many of them do involve cracking open the computer and poking around inside it. And upgrading laptop hardware will usually be more complicated than upgrading desktop computer hardware. Upgrades can be daunting for novice users without much computer hardware experience.

					Also keep in mind that opening up your computer will usually void its warranty. Therefore, if your computer is still under warranty, be cautious about undertaking hardware upgrades on your own.

					If you don't have the internal resources to perform an upgrade, outsourcing upgrades to a reliable, qualified technician is an option, though it will be more expensive than doing it on your own.
						The easiest way to speed up an older computer is to add more RAM. If your computer seems sluggish and the programs you're running seem to take up a lot of memory, adding RAM can make your computer perform a lot faster. If your computer is low on storage, it can also be quite easy to add an additional hard drive.

					Ask yourself whether a component upgrade is worth it before you get started. When you know what you're doing, upgrading computer components can help in certain situations. But it's important to weigh the time and cost of making the upgrade against the time and productivity you may be losing by not making it. </p>
					<p>Global revenue from computer hardware in 2016 reached 408 billion Euros.

			<h2>Motherboard</h2>
			<p>A motherboard, also called mainboard, main circuit board, system board, baseboard, planar board, logic board,or mobo is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in general-purpose computers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals.<p>

			<h2>Processing unit</h2>
			<p>A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the program.
